All of the webpages can be found under the 'root' folder and then in another folder called techstuff. They are labelled as: index.php, news.php, reviews.php and contact.php. Ensure that you download the zip so that the website will run correctly. Also run the usbwebserver.exe that came with this so that the website works as intended.
